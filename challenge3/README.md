Grow-only Counter
=================

This would be a simple matter of deferring everything to the sequentially-consistent KV store with a CAS for `add` requests if it weren't for the requirement that the final read to every node after the partition has healed be up-to-date, so to satisfy that constraint we attempt a qourum read of every node and the KV store on a `read` request, responding with the maximum of each response or our cached counter value if we got a timeout. To avoid losing writes in the case where we update our own cached counter value to reflect a neighbor's, and then an in-flight CAS succeeds and we update our cached counter to the successful result of the CAS and obliterate that update from our neighbor, we keep a record of what the delta was when we sent out that CAS, and rather than using the final swapped value from the CAS we just add that delta to our current cached counter value. This means that our cached counter's history may diverge from the KV store's history in ways that wouldn't happen if we just proxied to the KV store for everything, but since the counter is effectively a very simple CRDT this doesn't cause any issues.
